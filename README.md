EasyCode

EasyCode is a simple webpage that is designed to highlight the ease with which changes can be pushed to production using Cloud Foundry. 
The page will display a greeting as well as a Google map of the location specified in `getName()` function. The code 
will accept any location that Google Maps accepts, such as:

*	City and State. e.g. "Philadelphia, PA"
*	Airport codes. e.g. "BOS"
*	Addresses. e.g. "176 South Street Hopkinton, MA 01748"
*	Landmarks. e.g. "Grand Canyon"

There are multiple versions of the same application, each in a different language. Each page has a separate readme that explains how to install and update in that particular language.
